// This code is a JavaScript snippet that handles the behavior of a sign-in/sign-up container in a web page. It uses event listeners to toggle between the sign-in and sign-up modes when the respective buttons are clicked.

// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

// The code selects the necessary elements from the DOM using document.querySelector() and stores them in variables:

// sign_in_btn: Represents the button with the ID "sign-in-btn."
// sign_up_btn: Represents the button with the ID "sign-up-btn."
// container: Represents the container element with the class "container."
// An event listener is added to the sign_up_btn button. When this button 
// is clicked, the provided arrow function is executed. Inside the arrow function, 
// the class "sign-up-mode" is added to the container element. 
// This addition of the class will modify the appearance of the container based on the CSS rules associated with the "sign-up-mode" class.

// // Another event listener is added to the sign_in_btn button. When this button is clicked, 
// the provided arrow function is executed. Inside the arrow function, the class "sign-up-mode" is removed from the container element. 
// This removal of the class will revert the appearance of the container to its default state or 
// as defined in the CSS rules for the "container" class.

// // So, in summary, when the "Sign Up" button is clicked, the container element's class is updated to "sign-up-mode,
// " which might change the visual presentation of the sign-up form. And when the "Sign In" button is clicked, 
// the "sign-up-mode" class is removed from the container, potentially restoring the appearance of the sign-in form. 
// This code essentially toggles between sign-up and sign-in modes by adjusting the CSS styles through the manipulation 
// of classes on the container element.
